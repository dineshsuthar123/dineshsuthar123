## 🔄 How I Build Things — Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[📝 Design & RFC] --> B[🔬 Prototype & Benchmark]
    B --> C[📊 Instrument Early]
    C --> D[🧪 Tests & Perf Regression]
    D --> E[🚀 CI/CD & Rollout]
    E --> F[📈 Post-Deploy Audits]
```

1. **📝 Design & RFC** — Short design doc with acceptance criteria and target metrics
2. **🔬 Prototype & benchmark** — Micro-prototypes + JMH (micro) and Locust (end-to-end) to validate approach
3. **📊 Instrument early** — Metrics, logs, and tracing from day one (Prometheus + distributed tracing)
4. **🧪 Tests & perf regression** — Unit + integration tests, plus automated perf checks in CI
5. **🚀 CI/CD & rollout** — GitHub Actions + canary/staged rollouts with health checks
6. **📈 Post-deploy audits** — Dashboards, alerts, and regular perf regression runs

> This keeps features **measurable**, **safe to deploy**, and **easy to validate** for reviewers.
